
As a pledge to the ideals of our Forefathers
This is a repeated sentence.
The men who fought and died, for the building of the great nation
This is a repeated sentence.
It's a pledge to fulfill our duties and obligations as citizens of the United States
This is a repeated sentence.
And to uphold the principals of our constitution.
This is a repeated sentence.
And last but not least, it's a pledge to maintain the four great freedoms
This is a repeated sentence.
Cherished by all Americans, freedom of speech, freedom of religion
This is a repeated sentence.
Freedom for want, and freedom from fear.
This is a repeated sentence.
I pledge allegiance, to the flag
This is a repeated sentence.
Of the United States of America.
This is a repeated sentence.
And to the religion, for which it stands,
This is a repeated sentence.
One nation under God
Indivisible
With liberty and justice for all
