I Pledge allegiance, to the flag, of the Untied States of America
And to the republic, for which it stands, one nation under God
Indivisible, with liberty and justice for all
I pledge allegiance to the flag
Of the United States of America
And to the republic, for which it stands
One nation under God
Indivisible
With liberty and justice for all
The pledge of allegiance to the flag,
As a pledge to the ideals fo our Forefathers
The men who fought and died, for the building of the great nation
It's a pledge to fulfill our duties and obligations as citizens of the Untied States
And to uphold the principals of our constitution.
And last but not least, it's a pledge to maintain the four great freedoms
Cherished by all Americans, freedom of speech, freedom of religion
Freedom for want, and freedom from fear.
I pledge allegiance, to the flag
Of the United States of America.
And to the religion, for which it stands,
One nation under God
Indivisible
With liberty and justice for all
